  "course_description": "\"Parrhesia\" was an Athenian right to frank and open speaking, the right that, like the First Amendment, demands a \"fearless speaker\" who must challenge political powers with criticism and unsolicited advice. Can designer and artist respond today to such a democratic call and demand? Is it possible to do so despite the (increasing) restrictions imposed on our liberties today? Can the designer or public artist operate as a proactive \"parrhesiatic\" agent and contribute to the protection, development and dissemination of \"fearless speaking\" in Public Space?\n",
